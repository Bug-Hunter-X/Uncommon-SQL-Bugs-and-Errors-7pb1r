In SQL, a common error is using the wrong data type for a column.  For example, trying to store a large text string in a CHAR(10) column will truncate the string.  Another error is improper use of JOIN clauses, which can lead to incorrect results or slow queries.  Sometimes, programmers neglect to handle NULL values correctly, causing unexpected outcomes. Finally, SQL injection vulnerabilities happen when user input is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query, opening the door to malicious attacks.
