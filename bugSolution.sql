The solutions address the issues in the corresponding files in the `bug` directory.  Specifically:

*   **Data Type Mismatch:** The solution modifies the table schema to use a more appropriate data type (like TEXT instead of CHAR(10)) to accommodate the data without truncation. 
*   **Incorrect JOINs:**  The improved query uses the correct JOIN type (e.g., INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) and join conditions to produce the accurate results. 
*   **NULL Value Handling:** The solution adds checks for NULL values using functions like `IS NULL` or `COALESCE` to handle missing data gracefully. 
*   **SQL Injection:**  The solution uses parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities by separating user data from the SQL code.
